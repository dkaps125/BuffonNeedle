<h1>Buffon's Needle Experiment</h1>

This project is a simulation of Buffon's needle experiment. Buffon hypothesized that if one drops a needle onto a
sheet of paper with evenly spaced lines drawn on it, the ratio of times dropped to number of times the needle lands 
on a line will roughly equal pi.
